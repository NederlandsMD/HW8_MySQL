# MySQL Sakila DB Exercises

This project is composed of 8 mulit-step exercises using MySQL's built-in sakila database.

The exercises begin with basic select statements, using WHERE, ORDER BY, and IN to modify searches. Exercises include ALTER TABLE, COUNT, HAVING and ordering statements.

Later sections of the script update records, and conduct various types of joins, as well as nested select statements to pull together information from mulitple data tables.

Finally, the script saves some of the previous joins as views to allow for users to quickly return to pivotal summary information from the database
